\f0\fs24 \cf0 Goal of testing\
\
Not testing everything, find errors,  don\'92t prove correctness \
\

\f1\b Verification 
\f0\b0 means to prove correctness, prove correct inputs and correct behavior \
\

\f1\b Unit testing while coding
\f0\b0 \
Am I on the right track\
Testing methods\
Several test cases for every unit\
Using coverage\
\
Integration testing during integration\
Are this classes working together \
Take your code to me\
\
System testing dating system integration\
entirely system\
A system with all its parts \
\
Regression testing after change\
Happens after a change, test it again after change\
Rerun the test you did before to see if changes affected the system\
\
\
Beta testing pre release\
A small group of teaser test the hole system\
\
\
accptance testing during delivery\
Give the system to the costumer to se if we confirm with the requirements \
\
\
What done we gain from testing?\
Worked as specified, confident in system\
Provides unexpected output\
\
\
Manual testing write Test case\
Starts from the requirement, use-cases, go through every use case and write test from them\
Test the system through its interface\
rface,, interact with the system.\
Can be very effective, using the system as the user will use the system\
Can be costly, takes time if big system, regression testing, boring\
Coverage can be one use-case scenario\
\
\
Validation testing, are we building the right product? Are we solving the problems we should solve\
Verification testing,  are we building it right?\
\
\
What are the goals of testing?\
Building confidence in the product,  are the requirement meet, are there bugs, is everything that we say will be in the system there.\
Are all use-cases tested. \
\
Good enough? What says that I done a good job or not\
To test everything takes way to long time and cost too much. Test the risks, what are the risks?\
Is it lives at stake, we have to test more than if we test a game. Don\'92t overwork the test.\
If the program crash one of hundred it can be good enough\
\
Static testing is dry running the system, code inspections, manually review the code. Don\'92t run the program.\
Dynamic testing is automated testing ex JUnit, Manual testing running the program.\
